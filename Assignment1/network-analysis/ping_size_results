Maximum size of packets which give a response for each domain name as follows:

google.com: 68 bytes
facebook.com: 1464 bytes
iitd.ac.in: 14700 bytes (with very high packet loss)

Internal maximum size possible:

When I attempt to send a packet of size 100000, ping throws an error and tells me that I can send at most 65507 bytes. I suspect that this is because the maximum size of an IPv4 packet is 65535 and 28 bytes go into the header of the packet.

There is no such warning with IPv6 (which fails to elicit a response from the server but still sends something), so I did a binary search on the largest size that I can send without an error message, and it turns out to be 65527 bytes (the error thrown in that case was sendmsg: Message too long)
