IP addresses traversed - 
1. 192.168.1.1 - this is the private IP address of my router
2. 10.190.160.1 - this is a private IP address on my network
3. 196.195.157.1 - this is the IP address of a node on the public network (a whois lookup shows that this is allocated to AfriNIC)
4. 14.140.210.9 - this is the IP address of a Tata server (which seems to be the ISP of IITD)
5. 14.140.210.22 - this is again in the same sub-network (and indicates a subnet mask like 255.255.255.0)
After this, there is no connection, maybe due to blocked packets from IITD.

IP addresses traversed - 
1. 192.168.1.1 - this is the private IP address of my router
2. 10.190.160.1 - this is a private IP address on my network
3. 163.53.87.1 - this is an IP address on the ANI network
4. 72.14.221.86 - this is an IP address owned by Google, and this indicates that Google has set up a connection with local networks
5. 10.252.172.94, 10.23.221.158, 74.125.244.193 - these are three different IP addresses which are accessed by the three different packets in the 5th hop. The first two are private addresses (maybe on Google's internal network) and the last one is a public IP address on Google's network
6. 172.253.51.5, 172.253.67.88 - both of these are also owned by Google, and seem like they are on the same network (due to common prefix). However, note that these are not private addresses (since the private addresses starting with 172 are 172.16.*.* to 172.31.*.*)
7. 142.250.46.131, 108.170.251.124 - both of these are public IPs owned by Google, and till now, the variety of IP addresses shows a lot of redundancy in the network (multiple pathways to the destination)
8. 216.58.200.196 - this is the final target 

Note: there was no defaulting to IPv6 here (since my ISP doesn't support IPv6), so I tried using my mobile data hotspot, which had IPv6 connectivity. However the traceroute and ping commands give timeout, and on running tests on test-ipv6.com, it mentions that large packets fail - and since my phone doesn't have any of the configuration options, I couldn't work with IPv6.
However, the DNS query for ping (but not traceroute) defaulted to IPv6 address when using the mobile hotspot, even though it failed.

Anyway, to force the traceroute or ping command to use IPv4, we can use the option -4 in the command (like traceroute -4 www.google.com)

I also did another traceroute to www.google.com as follows:

On another traceroute to www.google.com, we can see that there were two packets which were sent to routers which didn't send any replies to the traceroute requests, as in hop 5.
